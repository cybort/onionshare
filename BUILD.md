# Building OnionShare

## GNU/Linux

Start by getting a copy of the source code:

```sh
git clone https://github.com/micahflee/onionshare.git
cd onionshare
```

*For .deb-based distros (like Debian, Ubuntu, Linux Mint):*

Note that python-stem appears in Debian wheezy and newer (so by extension Tails 1.1 and newer), and it appears in Ubuntu 13.10 and newer. Older versions of Debian and Ubuntu aren't supported.

```sh
sudo apt-get install -y build-essential fakeroot python-all python-stdeb python-flask python-stem python-qt4 python-crypto dh-python
./install/build_deb.sh
sudo dpkg -i deb_dist/onionshare_*.deb
```

*For .rpm-based distros (Red Hat, Fedora, CentOS):*

```sh
sudo yum install -y rpm-build python-flask python-stem pyqt4 python-crypto
./install/build_rpm.sh
sudo yum install -y dist/onionshare-*.rpm
```

*For ArchLinux:*

There is a PKBUILD available [here](https://aur.archlinux.org/packages/onionshare/) that can be used to install onionshare

## Mac OS X

Install the [latest python 2.x](https://www.python.org/downloads/) from python.org. If you use the built-in version of python that comes with OS X, your .app might not run on other people's computers.

To install the right dependencies, you need homebrew and pip installed on your Mac. Follow instructions at http://brew.sh/ to install homebrew, and run `sudo easy_install pip` to install pip.

The first time you're setting up your dev environment:

```sh
echo export PYTHONPATH=\$PYTHONPATH:/usr/local/lib/python2.7/site-packages/ >> ~/.profile
source ~/.profile
brew install qt4 pyqt
sudo pip install py2app flask stem pycrypto
```

Get the source code:

```sh
git clone https://github.com/micahflee/onionshare.git
cd onionshare
```

To build the .app:

```sh
install/build_osx.sh
```

Now you should have `dist/OnionShare.app`.

To codesign and build a .pkg for distribution:

```sh
install/build_osx.sh --sign
```

Now you should have `dist/OnionShare.pkg`.

## Windows

### Setting up your dev environment

* Download and install the latest python 2.7 from https://www.python.org/downloads/ -- make sure you install the 32-bit version.
* Go to Start and type "advanced system settings", and open "View advanced system settings" in the Control Panel. Click Environment Variables. Under "System variables" double-click on Path, and add `C:\Python27` and `C:\Python27\Scripts`. Now you can just type `python` to run python scripts in the command prompt.
* Go to https://pip.pypa.io/en/latest/installing.html. Right-click on `get-pip.py` and Save Link As, and save it to your home folder.
* Open a command prompt and type: `python get-pip.py`. Now you can use `pip` to install packages.
* Open a command prompt and type: `pip install flask stem pyinstaller pycrypto`
* Go to http://www.riverbankcomputing.com/software/pyqt/download and download the latest PyQt4 for Windows for python 2.7, 32-bit (I downloaded `PyQt4-4.11-gpl-Py2.7-Qt4.8.6-x32.exe`), then install it.
* Go to http://sourceforge.net/projects/pywin32/ and download and install the latest 32-bit pywin32 binary for python 2.7. I downloaded `pywin32-219.win32-py2.7.exe`.
* Download and install the [Microsoft Visual C++ 2008 Redistributable Package (x86)](http://www.microsoft.com/en-us/download/details.aspx?id=29).

If you want to build the installer:

* Go to http://nsis.sourceforge.net/Download and download the latest NSIS. I downloaded `nsis-3.0b0-setup.exe`.
* Go to Start and type "advanced system settings", and open "View advanced system settings" in the Control Panel. Click Environment Variables. Under "System variables" double-click on Path, and add `C:\Program Files (x86)\NSIS` to the end. Now you can just type `makensis [script]` to build an installer.

If you want to sign binaries with Authenticode:

* You'll need a code signing certificate. I roughly followed [this guide](http://blog.assarbad.net/20110513/startssl-code-signing-certificate/) to make one using my StartSSL account.
* Once you get a code signing key and certificate and covert it to a pfx file, import it into your certificate store.
* Windows 7:
  * Go to http://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/vstudio/aa496123 and install the latest .NET Framework. I installed `.NET Framework 4.6`.
  * Go to http://www.microsoft.com/en-us/download/confirmation.aspx?id=8279 and install the Windows SDK.
  * Right click on Computer, go to Properties. Click "Advanced system settings". Click Environment Variables. Under "System variables" double-click on Path and add `C:\Program Files\Microsoft SDKs\Windows\v7.1\Bin` to the end.
* Windows 10:
  * Go to https://dev.windows.com/en-us/downloads/windows-10-sdk and install the standalone Windows 10 SDK. Note that you may not need this if you already have Visual Studio.
  * Go to Start and type "advanced system settings", and open "View advanced system settings" in the Control Panel. Click Environment Variables. Under "System variables" double-click on Path, and add `C:\Program Files (x86)\Windows Kits\10\bin\x86`.

### To make a .exe:

* Open a command prompt, cd into the onionshare directory, and type: `pyinstaller -y install\onionshare-win.spec`. Inside the `dist` folder there will be a folder called `onionshare` with `onionshare.exe` in it.

### To build the installer:

Note that you must have a codesigning certificate installed in order to use the `install\build_exe.bat` script, because it codesigns `onionshare.exe`, `uninstall.exe`, and `OnionShare_Setup.exe`.

Open a command prompt, cd to the onionshare directory, and type: `install\build_exe.bat`

This will prompt you to codesign three binaries and execute one unsigned binary. When you're done clicking through everything you will have `dist\OnionShare_Setup.exe`.

## Tests

OnionShare includes [nose](https://nose.readthedocs.org/en/latest/) unit tests. First,

```sh
sudo pip install nose
```

To run the tests:

```sh
nosetests test
```
